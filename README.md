# Fishing_For_Bass

Rules: 

3 - 6  Players

Each Player will start with one Warrior in a spot of their choosing. 
Order of player choosing is decided by a random and turns go counter clockwise from there.

On Turn 1, each placed warrior will automatically CLAIM that terrritory
Each territory gives either 5, 3, 1, or 0 of a RESOURCE
Madagascar is the only exception to this, which give 5 of eahc RESOURCE

RESOURCES:  FOOD,  WOOD,  STEEL,  OIL
Each Resource has it's own value and is more/less valuable at different points in the game. This allows for late/early game builds
    This is essentially the currency of the game
    ex. Food is amazing early while oil is next to useles but oil becomes extremely good later

CLAIM: To begin claiming a territory, simply move a character into an uninhabited space.
    ***Claiming territories takes more than 0 turns unlike Civ or Risk. In Fishing For Bass, it takes *5* consecutive turns of claimed ownership to begin receiving resources***
