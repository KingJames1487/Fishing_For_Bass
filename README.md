Rules: 

3 - 6  Players

Each player goes once in a round, going counterclockwise.

Each Player will start with one Warrior in a spot of their choosing, and automatically CLAIM that terrritory.

Each territory gives either 5, 3, 1, or 0 of a RESOURCE, with exception to Madagascar which gives 5 of each.

RESOURCES:  FOOD,  WOOD,  STEEL,  OIL

CLAIM: Claiming territories requires 5 consecutive turns of OWNERSHIP to begin receiving resources. 
A Claimed territory will produce the specified resources for the player. A territory is UNCLAIMED if you no 
longer own units there.

OWNERSHIP : Ownership is defined as being the only player with a unit on any territory.

TURN :
    START PHASE : At the Start of your turn, you first gain one point of OWNERSHIP towards any territories 
    not yet CLAIMED. Then, recieve any rescources you may acrue from your CLAIMED territories.
    
    BUY PHASE : Here, you may spend any resources you choose, any Units or Arial Units must be placed on a 
    territory, Water must be placed on a Coastline you own, and BARRIERS must be placed on a Border partially 
    owned by you.
    
    ACTION PHASE : Here, you may move or Attack Units. Once per round, you may choose to expend 1 of a 
    Units Speed to Attack. If the Attack leaves the Defending territory without OWNERSHIP, the Attacking
